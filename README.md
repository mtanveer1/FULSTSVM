# FULSTSVM

This is implementation of the paper: B. Richhariya, M. Tanveer, A fuzzy universum least squares twin support vector machine (FULSTSVM).

Description of files:

main.m: Runs FULSTSVM with optimal parameters selected from grid search.

FULSTSVM.m: Implementation of FULSTSVM algorithm. Takes parameters c1, c3, epsilon, mu, and training data and test data, and provides accuracy obtained and running time.

cfuzz.m: Implements the fuzzy membership function.

For quickly reproducing the results of the FULSTSVM algorithm, we have made a newd folder containing sample datasets. One can simply run the main.m file to check the obtained results on the sample datasets. To run experiments on more datasets, simply add datasets in the newd folder and run main.m file. The code has been tested on Windows 10 with MATLAB R2017a.
